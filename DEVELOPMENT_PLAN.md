# Detailed Development Plan and Overall Todo List for Learning Notes

This will act as a collection of anything I want to update or fix regarding my
learning notes.

I don't plan to make fixes or changes linearly - I may jump around as suits my
time and needs

## To Do's

- Update the links in the root README.md file

- (Java) Add overriding methods
- (Java) Add overloading methods
- (Java) Private, Final, Public methods/fields (note how private methods/fields
  are not directly accessible but still inherited and accessible by public methods)
- (Java) Sealed classes
- (Java) Polymorphism - Using different classes of common sub class
- (Java) Polymorphism - Object typecasting
- (Java) Polymorphism - instanceof
- (Java) Polymorphism - shortcut for checking instanceof and creating variable
  if (rocky instanceof Cat rockyThecat){}
- (Java) Abstract classes - Create abstract classes w/ abstract and non abstract methods
- (Java) Abstract classes - Inheriting from abstract classes and implementing abstract methods
  Add notes regarding abstract classes/methods as templates and how to use (subclass only)
- (Java) Interfaces - Create interfaces w/ and w/o static fields (note that defaults fields to public static final)
- (Java) Interfaces - Implementing interfaces and instantiating interfaces
- (Java) Interfaces - default methods
- (Java) Interfaces - static methods
- General - Try to include start/end examples (one folder start, one folder end) to provide examples of
  what a program looks like before and after something new is implemented. May help put things in context
  Go through examples to see if anything would benefit from this
- (Java) Collections - overview of notes regarding collections and how they work. markdown page
- (Java) Collections - Using an iterator
- (Java) Collections - How to use an iterator with Map (using EntrySet)
- (Java) Collections - using a forEach and a lambda expression
- (Java) Lambda Expressions - A lambda expression is a short block of code that, just like a method, accepts parameters and returns a value. They differ from methods in that they do not have names, and they're executed in-line versus being called by other methods.
- TODO (Java) Collections - explore how to use algorithms on java.util.Collections
